These files are just a handful that came from [this academic corpus of phishing emails](https://academictorrents.com/details/a77cda9a9d89a60dbdfbe581adf6e2df9197995a). Note that the files in this corpus all have a beginning line that contains "From nobody...". This isn't part of the .eml file specification, so rather than including this handling in the email parser, I cleaned up these files to remove those lines.
