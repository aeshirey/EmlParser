# EmlParser
`EmlParser' is a crate intended to parse `.eml` files. Currently, this crate is very basic, supporting extracting field `(name,value)` pairs from an email header plus the body of the message. Special headers `To`, `From`, and `Subject` are separated out; all others are currently listed in a `Vec<HeaderField>`.

The parsing for this crate attempts to follow [RFC-0822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt), though in practice there seem to be deviations from the RFC as to how to handle newlines. The spec lays out that the body and header are separated by a null line, as delimited by <kbd>CRLF</kbd>. Often, we'll actually see <kdb>\n\n</kbd>, so `EmlParser` allows <kbd>\n\n</kbd>, <kbd>\r\r</kbd>, and <kbd>\r\n\r\n</kbd>.

Note that header fields _are_ able to include newlines in them, defined as [linear whitespace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21072713/what-exactly-is-the-linear-whitespace-lws-lwsp).

Finding the separator between the header and body follows the following transition digram:

# Usage
You can use `EmlParser` with a `&str` or a filename:

```rust
